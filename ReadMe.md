A coffee shop has requested the implementation of an application that will help them calculate the income from all orders made during the day.For this purpose they have exposed 2 REST services that will help you get the data that are needed.

1. The  1stREST  service  returns  all  the  available  beveragesand  condiments  with  their  respective  cost.
2. The 2ndservice provides data from their ordering system.

The application gets the data from the REST services described above and calculate:

1. the cost of each order 
2. the total income from all given orders

The outcome of the Java app is a text file that contains the results of the calculations.
